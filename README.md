# Advent of Code C++ Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! Here, I solve Advent of Code problems using C++. This repository contains solutions for all previous years' challenges.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event in December where programming enthusiasts solve daily coding challenges. Each day, a new problem is released, and participants work to solve it as quickly as possible.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by year and day. Each year has its own directory, and within each year, there are subdirectories for each day's challenge.

```

```

## How to Run

To compile and run the solutions, you need to have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC). Navigate to the directory of the specific day's challenge and compile the code using the following commands:

```sh
g++ -o solution dayXX.cpp
./solution
```

Replace `dayXX.cpp` with the appropriate file name.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a better solution or find a bug, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
